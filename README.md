# Circle CI Image Builder

Welcome to XO's fork of Circle CI's Image Builder. This repo has a customized Dockerfile used for XO's instances of Circle CI Builder which has [certain language and application versions](https://github.com/xogroup/image-builder/wiki/Version-List).

## When should I be using this image builder?

This image builder is geared towards placing new languages/frameworks/technologies as well as updating existing ones.

## How do I update our Circle CI builder images?

Updated images **must** be deployed with **new** builder instances. In order to setup and deploy a new builder instance, [click here](https://github.com/xogroup/image-builder/wiki/Setting-up-and-deploying-a-new-builder-instance)
